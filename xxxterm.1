.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a minimalistic web browser that tries to stay out of the way so that
valuable screen real estate can be used for much more important stuff.
It has sane defaults and does not require one to learn a language to do any
configuration.
It was written by hackers for hackers and it strives to be small, compact and
fast.
.Pp
When
.Nm
starts up, it reads settings from its configuration file,
.Pa xxxterm.conf .
See the
.Sx CONFIGURATION FILES
section below.
.Pp
The following notation is used throughout this page:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It Cm M
Meta
.It Cm S
Shift
.It Cm C
Control
.It Cm M1
Mouse button 1
.El
.Pp
.Nm
is very simple in its use.
Most of the actions are initiated via key or mouse bindings.
See the
.Sx BINDINGS
section below for defaults and customizations.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl f Ar file
Use alternate config file.
.It Fl S
Disable the toolbar.
.It Fl T
Disable visualization of tabs.
.It Fl t
Disable tabs.
.It Fl V
Display version and exit.
.El
.Sh CONFIGURATION FILES
.Nm
tries to open the user specific file,
.Pa ~/.xxxterm.conf .
If that file is unavailable,
it then uses built-in defaults.
.Pp
The format of the file is \*(Ltkeyword\*(Gt = \*(Ltsetting\*(Gt.
For example:
.Pp
.Dl http_proxy = http://127.0.0.1:8080
.Pp
Enabling or disabling an option is done by using 1 or 0 respectively.
.Pp
The file supports the following keywords:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "title_class_enabledXXX" -offset indent -compact
.It Cm ctrl_click_focus
Give focus in newly created tab instead of opening it in the background.
.It Cm read_only_cookies
Mark cookies file read-only and discard all cookies once the sessions is
terminated.
.It Cm cookies_enabled
Enable cookies.
.It Cm enable_scripts
Enable scripts.
.It Cm enable_plugins
Enable plugins.
.It Cm default_font_size
Set the default browsing font size.
.It Cm default_font_family
Set the default browsing font family.
.It Cm serif_font_family
Set the serif font family.
.It Cm sans_serif_font_family

.It Cm monospace_font_family

.It Cm default_encoding

.It Cm http_proxy

.It Cm download_dir
Locations where files are downloaded to.
This directory must exist and
.Nm
validates that during startup.
.It Cm fancy_bar
Enables a backward, forward and stop button to the toolbar.
Additionally if search_string is set it'll enable an entry box for searches.
.It Cm search_string
Default search engine string.
See xxxterm.conf file for details.
.It Cm mime_type
Sets an action for a specific or default MIME type.
For example, to download and view a pdf using kpdf set mime_type =
application/pdf,kpdf.
To set a default value use *, for example mime_type = video/*,mplayer.
Note that the action is only passed the URI and not all applications are
capable of downloading content and therefore one might have to create a wrapper
script to download the content first.
.It Cm alias
Defines an alias for a given URL, so that the URL is loaded when the alias is
entered in the address bar.
If the aliased URL includes a %s format specifier, then any argument given after
the alias on the address bar is substituted.
For example, if g,http://www.google.com/search?q=%s is defined as an alias,
then the URL http://www.google.com/search?q=foo is loaded when navigating to
"g foo".
.El
.Pp
.Nm
overrides http_proxy if it is specified as an environment variable.
