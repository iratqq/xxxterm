.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a minimalistic web browser that tries to stay out of the way so that
valuable screen real estate can be used for much more important stuff.
It has sane defaults and does not require one to learn a language to do any
configuration.
It was written by hackers for hackers and it strives to be small, compact and
fast.
.Pp
When
.Nm
starts up, it reads settings from its configuration file,
.Pa xxxterm.conf .
See the
.Sx CONFIGURATION FILES
section below.
.Pp
The following notation is used throughout this page:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It Cm M
Meta
.It Cm S
Shift
.It Cm C
Control
.It Cm M1
Mouse button 1
.El
.Pp
.Nm
is very simple in its use.
Most of the actions are initiated via key or mouse bindings.
See the
.Sx BINDINGS
section below for defaults and customizations.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl f Ar file
Use alternate config file.
.It Fl S
Disable the toolbar.
.It Fl T
Disable visualization of tabs.
.It Fl t
Disable tabs.
.It Fl V
Display version and exit.
.El
.Sh CONFIGURATION FILES
.Nm
tries to open the user specific file,
.Pa ~/.xxxterm.conf .
If that file is unavailable,
it then uses built-in defaults.
.Pp
The format of the file is \*(Ltkeyword\*(Gt = \*(Ltsetting\*(Gt.
For example:
.Pp
.Dl http_proxy = http://127.0.0.1:8080
.Pp
Enabling or disabling an option is done by using 1 or 0 respectively.
.Pp
The file supports the following keywords:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "title_class_enabledXXX" -offset indent -compact
.It Cm ctrl_click_focus

.It Cm fancy_bar

Additionally if search_string is set it'll enable an entry box for searches.
.It Cm refresh_interval
Refresh interval while in the download manager.
Default is 10.
.It Cm session_timeout
If this value is greater than 3600 then it is the time added in seconds to a
session cookie.  If the value is smaller than 3600 then there is no change
to the expiration of a session cookie.
.It Cm enable_cookie_white list
When enabled all cookies must be in the white list or they are rejected.
.It Cm cookie_wl
This is a cookie white list item.
Use multiple times to add multiple entries.
Valid entries are for example *.moo.com and the equivalent .moo.com.
A fully qualified host is also valid and is for example www.moo.com.

Possible values are: no3rdparty, reject 3rd party cookies.

.It Cm search_string

See xxxterm.conf file for details.
.It Cm mime_type
Sets an action for a specific or default MIME type.
For example, to download and view a pdf using kpdf set mime_type =
application/pdf,kpdf.
To set a default value use *, for example mime_type = video/*,mplayer.
Note that the action is only passed the URI and not all applications are
capable of downloading content and therefore one might have to create a wrapper
script to download the content first.
.It Cm alias
Defines an alias for a given URL, so that the URL is loaded when the alias is
entered in the address bar.
If the aliased URL includes a %s format specifier, then any argument given after
the alias on the address bar is substituted.
For example, if g,http://www.google.com/search?q=%s is defined as an alias,
then the URL http://www.google.com/search?q=foo is loaded when navigating to
"g foo".
.It Cm ssl_ca_file
If set to a valid PEM file all server certificates will be validated against it.
The URL bar will be colored green when the certificate is trusted and yellow when
untrusted.
.Pp
If ssl_ca_file is not set then the URL bar will color all https connections red.
.It Cm ssl_strict_certs
If this value is set connections to untrusted sites will be aborted.
This value is only used if ssl_ca_file is set.
